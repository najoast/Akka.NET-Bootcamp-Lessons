This is an open-source mirror of the [Akka.NET Bootcamp Lessons](https://petabridge.com/bootcamp/lessons/).

The reason for this mirror is that I always struggled with the lack of a night mode when watching this course. It was fine during the day, but at night it was as blinding as a flashbang.

Another major pain point was the unintuitive navigation:

1. The opened page wasn't highlighted in the left-hand navigation, making it difficult to know where I was.
2. The courses weren't numbered; they were only linked by Previous & Next Lessons.

These problems made watching this course quite a painful experience.

So, I organized it into Markdown format and stored it in Obsidian, numbering each course.

This largely solves the above problems.

By the way, during the organization process, I also discovered some issues with the Mermaid graph rendering position.

Since this Markdown version was very helpful to me, I thought it would be helpful to others as well, so I'm open-sourcing it.

Finally, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Petabridge for developing such a wonderful Actor framework; you guys have done a great job. Thank you for your great contributions to the .NET community!
