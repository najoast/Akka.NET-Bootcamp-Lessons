Welcome to Akka.NET Bootcamp - a free, self-paced course designed to help you learn how to build [Akka.NET](https://getakka.net/) applications from scratch.

> If you’ve [signed up for our Bootcamp Emails](https://petabridge.com/bootcamp/signup), each of these units will be delivered to you roughly once every 2 days. You’ll also get the latest posts from [our blog, _Beyond HTTP_,](https://petabridge.com/blog/) delivered to you.

## Getting Started

To get started with Akka.NET Bootcamp, please do the following things:

1. Fork and `git clone` the [https://github.com/petabridge/akka-bootcamp](https://github.com/petabridge/akka-bootcamp) repository onto your local machine. This repository contains the code samples you’ll be building / modifying and also includes the finished product, in case you get stuck.
    ```sh
      git clone https://github.com/petabridge/akka-bootcamp.git
    ```
2. [Subscribe to Petabridge on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@petabridge?sub_confirmation=1) - ok, you don’t _have_ to do this but we’d appreciate it.
3. Install the [`Akka.Templates` package](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akkadotnet-templates) onto your machine - you’ll need this for some of the lessons and it will also make sure you have Visual Studio / Rider / `dotnet new` templates available on your local machine for whenever you want to create an Akka.NET project.

```sh
dotnet new install "Akka.Templates::*"
```

And if you already have the templates installed but wish to update them:

```sh
dotnet new update
```
